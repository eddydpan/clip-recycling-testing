# clip-recycling-testing

In this repository, you will find all the resources we used for testing.

To repeat our testing process, clone this repository. We used Python 3.10.9 in our tests, so we
recommend you use the same. Download the required libraries from the requirements.txt file, then 
run the python script. All of the results are saved as pandas dataframes in .csv files.
